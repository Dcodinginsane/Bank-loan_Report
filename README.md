Key Features :

🔹 Total Loan Applications: Tracks total applications, Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.

🔹 Total Funded Amount: Analyzes the total disbursed funds with MTD and MoM comparisons to monitor funding trends.

🔹 Cash Flow Insights: Monitors the total amount received from borrowers, alongside MTD and MoM changes for better cash flow management.

🔹 Average Interest Rate: Calculates and tracks average interest rates, providing a clear view of lending costs over time.

🔹 Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluates borrowers' financial health with average DTI calculations, MTD analysis, and MoM fluctuations.

✔ Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Metrics:

The report also distinguishes between good and bad loans, offering insights into:

⏺ Good Loan Application Percentage

⏺ Bad Loan Application Percentage

⏺ Funded amounts and total received for both categories

🔶 Visual Insights:

I utilized a variety of visuals to enhance data representation:

📈 KPI Cards for quick performance metrics

📊 Bar Charts for comparative analysis

📉 Line Charts to visualize trends over time

🉑 Donut Charts for proportional insights

🚰 Table Visuals for detailed information

🗺 Fill Map to show geographic distribution

💹 Treemaps for hierarchical data representation

➡ Filters and Slicers to enable dynamic data exploration

⏹ The grid view report categorizes all loans by status, presenting a clear overview of metrics like total applications, funded amounts, and average interest rates. 

1. **SQL Server:**
   - Data Gathering: Import raw sales data from various sources into a SQL Server database.
   - Data Profiling:Use SQL queries to profile the data, identifying data types, distributions, and missing values.
